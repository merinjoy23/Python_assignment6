1. Propose how you would calculate total time spent in ICU during hospitalization. Be specific what fields to use. Show example code using MIMIC III data.
2. Suppose you want to build a model that predicts patient mortality anytime during hospital stay. You have access to ICD codes in the data (MIMIC III). Is it reasonable to use them in prediction? Explain why?
3. You are given a set of LOINC codes and need to extract corresponding data during one ICU stay. Describe the process. Provide all needed details, including field names, etc.
